# RobloxAssetDownloader
A simple tool allowing you to download Roblox clothing assets because every other one seems to be either a virus or broken.<br>
This tool is depreciated due to [Roblox AssetDelivery API not properly utilising CORS](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/cors-error-on-users-api/1614679/6).

# ⚠️ Use the updated working version [here](https://github.com/uDMBK/RobloxAssetDownloader-CSharp). ⚠️

<hr>

It is highly recommended you use the updated C# WinForm above and not the web version as it will not work on modern web browsers (eg. Firefox, Chrome, Safari) due to modern security policies.
[Take me to the depreciated web version anyway!](https://github.com/uDMBK/RobloxAssetDownloader)
